## Setup

### Prerequisites

This guide assumes that you have:

- A running Teleport Cluster.
- Admin privileges with access to `tctl`.
- Slack Admin Privileges to create an app and install it to your workspace.

Teleport Cloud requires connecting through the proxy service (`mytenant.teleport.sh:443`).
If you want the Slack plugin to connect through the web port (`teleport.example.com:443`) follow the Teleport Cloud instructions.
OpenSource and Enterprise installations can connect to the auth service (`auth.example.com:3025`) directly.


### Installing the Teleport Slack Plugin

We recommend installing the Teleport Plugins alongside the Teleport Proxy. This is an ideal
location as plugins have a low memory footprint, and will require both public internet access
and Teleport Auth access. We currently only provide linux-amd64 binaries, you can also compile
these plugins from [source](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport-plugins/tree/master/access/slack).

**Install the plugin**

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="Download">
  ```code
  $ curl -L -O https://get.gravitational.com/teleport-access-slack-v(=teleport.version=)-linux-amd64-bin.tar.gz
  $ tar -xzf teleport-access-slack-v(=teleport.version=)-linux-amd64-bin.tar.gz
  ```
  Run `./teleport-access-slack/install`, or manually place `./teleport-access-slack/teleport-slack`
  into an appropriate location within the sytem's PATH. e.g. `/usr/bin`, `/usr/local/bin`.
  ```
  $ cd teleport-access-slack
  $ sudo ./install
  ```
</TabItem>
<TabItem label="From Source">
  To install from source you need `git` and `go >= (=teleport.golang=)` installed.

  ```code
  # Checkout teleport-plugins
  $ git clone https://github.com/gravitational/teleport-plugins.git
  $ cd teleport-plugins/access/slack
  $ make
```
  Place `./teleport-access-slack/teleport-slack` into an appropriate location within the sytem's PATH. e.g. `/usr/bin`, `/usr/local/bin`.
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Create User and Role for the plugin

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="OpenSource, Enterprise" scope={["oss","enterprise"]}>
Log into the Teleport Authentication Server, this is where you normally run `tctl`. Create a
new user and role that only has API access to the `access_request` API. The below script
will create a yaml resource file for a new user and role.
</TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Cloud" scope={["cloud"]}>

The Teleport Cloud requires authenticating with a role that has [`impersonation`](https://goteleport.com/docs/access-controls/guides/impersonation/)
rights and can create the `access-plugin` role and user. Login in with `tsh` with a user that has this role or has a role with these allows.
```
kind: role
version: v5
metadata:
  name: plugin-admin
spec:
  allow:
    impersonate:
      roles:
      - access-plugin
      users:
      - access-plugin
    rules:
      - resources: ['roles']
        verbs: ['create','update','read','list','delete']
      - resources: ['user']
        verbs: ['create','update','read','list','delete']

```
  </TabItem>
  
</Tabs>

Create a non-interactive bot `access-plugin` user and role.

```yaml
kind: user
version: v2
metadata:
  name: access-plugin
spec:
  roles: ['access-plugin']
---
kind: role
version: v5
metadata:
  name: access-plugin
spec:
  allow:
    rules:
      - resources: ['access_request']
        verbs: ['list', 'read']
      - resources: ['access_plugin_data']
        verbs: ['update']
```

Here and below follow along and create yaml resources using `tctl create -f`:

```
$ tctl create -f access.yaml
```

<Admonition type="tip">
  If you're using other plugins, you might want to create different users and roles for different plugins
</Admonition>

#### Export access-plugin Certificates

The Teleport Slack plugin uses the `access-plugin` user when sending requests to the 
Teleport Auth server. To include the user's credentials in Teleport API requests, we 
generate TLS and SSH certificates for the user, using [`tctl auth sign`](../../setup/reference/cli.mdx#tctl-auth-sign).

```code
$ tctl auth sign --user=access-plugin --out="access-plugin.pem" --ttl=2190h
# ...
# create a data directory to hold certificate files for the plugin.
$ sudo mkdir -p /var/lib/teleport/plugins/slack
$ sudo mv access-plugin.pem /var/lib/teleport/plugins/slack/access-plugin.pem
```

The above sequence should generate one PEM encoded file with the `access-plugin` user's certificates
and place it in "/var/lib/teleport/plugins/slack" where we can reference it when [configuring the plugin](#configuring-teleport-slack-plugin).

<Admonition
  type="note"
  title="Certificate Lifetime"
>
  By default, [`tctl auth sign`](../../setup/reference/cli.mdx#tctl-auth-sign) produces certificates with a relatively short lifetime.
  For production deployments, the `--ttl` flag can be used to ensure a more practical certificate lifetime. `--ttl=8760h` exports a 1 year token.

### Create Slack App

You'll need to:

1. Create a new app, pick a name and select a workspace it belongs to.
2. Add OAuth Scopes. This is required by Slack for the app to be installed — we'll only need a single scope to post messages to your Slack account.
3. Obtain OAuth token

#### Creating a New Slack app

Visit [https://api.slack.com/apps](https://api.slack.com/apps) to create a new Slack App.

**App Name:** Teleport<br/>
**Development Slack Workspace:** Pick the workspace you'd like the requests to show up in. <br/>
**App Icon:** <a href="../../../img/enterprise/plugins/teleport_bot@2x.png" download>Download Teleport Bot Icon</a>

![Create Slack App](../../../img/enterprise/plugins/slack/Create-a-Slack-App.png)

#### Selecting OAuth Scopes

On the App screen, go to “OAuth and Permissions” under Features in the sidebar menu. Then scroll to Scopes, and add `chat:write, incoming-webhook, users:read, users:read.email` scopes so that our plugin can post messages to your Slack channels.

#### Obtain OAuth Token

![OAuth Tokens](../../../img/enterprise/plugins/slack/OAuth.png)

#### Add to Workspace

![OAuth Tokens](../../../img/enterprise/plugins/slack/Slackbot-Permissions.png)
After adding to the workspace, you still need to invite the bot to the channel. Do this by using the @ command,
and inviting them to the channel.

### Configuring Teleport Slack Plugin

Teleport Slack uses a config file in TOML format. Generate a boilerplate config by
running the following command and place it in the `/etc` directory where it can be
read by the plugin.

```code
$ teleport-slack configure > teleport-slack.toml
$ sudo mv teleport-slack.toml /etc
```

#### Editing the config file

We need to edit the config files with values specific to your Teleport and Slack App intances.

Open the config file we just generated - `/etc/teleport-slack.toml` - and you should see the following fields which we need to edit.

**`[teleport]`**

This section is used to connect to your Teleport Auth Server.

`addr`: set this to the your Auth Server address, Reverse Tunnel address,
or Proxy address. This address must be reachable from the Teleport Slack Plugin.

<Admonition
  type="note"
  title="Cloud Proxy Address"
>
  For Teleport Cloud, the Auth Server must be reached through the Teleport Proxy address. e.g. "teleport.example.com:443".
</Admonition>

`identity`: set this to the path to the identity file generated in the [export certificates](#export-access-plugin-certificates) section.

```toml
identity = "/var/lib/teleport/plugins/slack/access-plugin.pem"
```
 
**`[slack]`**

This section is used to connect to your Slack workspace.

`token`: set this to the token found in the [Obtain OAuth Token](#obtain-oauth-token) section

**`[role_to_recipients]`**

This section is used to configure where the plugin will send access requests
in the Slack workspace.

Provide one or more mappings from a role to recipient(s). Each recipient must be a slack email or channel. Example:

```toml
[role_to_recipients]
# A wildcard `*` entry must be provided to map un-entered roles to default recipients.
"*" = ["admin@email.com", "admin-slack-channel"]
"dev" = "dev-slack-channel"
```

**`[log]`**

This section can be changed to change the plugin's logging attributes.

`output`: where to output logs - can be set to `stdout`, `stderr`, or a log folder.

`severity`: what severity to log with - can be `INFO`, `ERROR`, `DEBUG`, or `WARN`.

In Slack section, use the OAuth token provided by Slack.

## Test Run

Assuming that Teleport is running, you've created the Slack app, and the plugin is
configured, you can now run the plugin and test the workflow!

```code
$ teleport-slack start
```

If everything works fine, the log output should look like this:

```code
$ teleport-slack start
INFO   Starting Teleport Access Slack Plugin 7.2.1: slack/app.go:80
INFO   Plugin is ready slack/app.go:101
```

### Testing the approval workflow

Create an access request with and check if the plugin works as expected with the following steps.

### Creating an access request

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="As admin">
  A Teleport admin can create an access request for another user with `tctl`.
  ```code
  # Replace USERNAME with a Teleport local user, and TARGET_ROLE with a Teleport Role
  $ tctl request create USERNAME --roles=TARGET_ROLE
  ```
</TabItem>
<TabItem label="As user">
  Users can use `tsh` to create an access request and login with approved roles.
  ```code
  # Replace TARGET_ROLE with a Teleport Role
  $ tsh request new --roles=TARGET_ROLE
  Seeking request approval... (id: 8f77d2d1-2bbf-4031-a300-58926237a807)
  ```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

The configured slack recipients should receive a new message notification of a new pending request.

### Resolve the request

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="As admin">
  ```code
  # Replace REQUEST_ID with the id of the request
  $ tctl request approve REQUEST_ID
  $ tctl request deny REQUEST_ID
  ```
</TabItem>
<TabItem label="As user">
  ```code
  # Replace REQUEST_ID with the id of the request
  $ tsh request review --approve REQUEST_ID
  $ tsh request review --deny REQUEST_ID
  ```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Once the request is resolved, the slack bot will make an emoji reaction of ✅ or ❌ on the slack 
message depending on the new resolve state.

### Setup with SystemD

In production, we recommend starting teleport plugin daemon via an init system like systemd .
Here's the recommended Teleport Plugin service unit file for systemd:

```ini
(!examples/systemd/plugins/teleport-slack.service!)
```

Save this as `teleport-slack.service`.

## Audit Log

The plugin will let anyone with access to the Slack Channel so it's
important to review Teleport' audit log.
